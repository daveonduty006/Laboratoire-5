## **Python Project #5**
### 'The Auto Repair Shop Program' ###
***
*working with  OOP (classes and polymorphism)*
***

### Description ###
    This fifth project is the creation of a Billing System for a Auto Repair Shop. The system allows for the adding and removal of repairs and statistics relating to the income and status of each reparation object. This was my first project using object-oriented programming.

### Steps of the Project ###
    
    ** Step 1 **
    Create the constructor of the Car class. Each car object must have the following attributes: Brand, Model, Year and Color.

    ** Step 2 **
    Create a method allowing each car objects to be returned in a string format containing all the car's attributes. 

    ** Step 3 **
    Create the constructor of the Repair class. Each Repair object must have information relating to its name, cost, time needed for completion (in hours) and current status (done/not-done).

    ** Step 4 **
    Create a method allowing each repair objects to be returned in a string format containing all the repair's attributes. 

    ** Step 5 **
    Create the constructor of the Billing System class. The billing system must be initiated with a list of car objects and a list of repair objects. Each repair objects must be associated with one car object (1 repair for 1 car). 
    HINT: 2D LIST 

    ** Step 6 **
    Create different Billing System methods allowing for: 
        Adding/Removing a repair (along with the paired vehicle)
        Display a list of all repairs (along with the paired vehicle)
        Show the shop's average income by the hour
        Show the total amount of hours worked on done repair jobs
        Show the total income from done repair jobs
        Show the total amount of hours of repair jobs still to be done
        Show the total income missed from repair jobs still to be done

    ** Step 7 **
    Create a looping menu allowing a user to access one of the methods created in Step 6 along with an exit (end program) choice.
